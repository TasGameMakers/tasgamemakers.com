## What we collect

### Website analytics

We use [Umami](https://umami.is), a privacy-focused analytics tool, to understand how people use this website. Umami does not use cookies, does not track you across websites, and does not collect any personal information. All data is aggregated and anonymous.

What Umami records:

- Page views (which pages are visited)
- Referrer (how you found us)
- Browser and device type
- Country of origin

What Umami does **not** record:

- Your IP address (it is never stored)
- Any personal or identifying information
- Activity across other websites

You cannot be identified from this data, individually or in combination. Umami is compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR, and does not require a cookie consent banner.

### Newsletter

If you sign up to our newsletter, your email address is stored and managed by [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com). We use it only to send you occasional updates about Tas Game Makers events and news. You can unsubscribe at any time using the link in every email. Mailchimp's own privacy policy applies to how they handle your data.

### Information you provide

If you contact us by email or through Discord, we only use the information you provide to respond to your message. We don't add you to mailing lists or share your details.

If you sign up for membership through our website, that information is handled by our payment provider and is covered by their privacy policy, not this one.

## What we don't do

- We don't use cookies for tracking or advertising.
- We don't run third-party advertising on this website.
- We don't sell, share, or give away any data to third parties.
- We don't use Facebook Pixel, Google Analytics, or similar tracking tools.

## Third-party services

This website links to or uses external services such as Discord, Eventbrite, Mailchimp, and Screen Tasmania. Those services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.

## Changes

If we update this policy, we'll publish the changes on this page.

## Contact
