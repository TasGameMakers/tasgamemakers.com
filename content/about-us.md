**Whether you're a seasoned professional, a student, a hobbyist, or just curious about games—Tas Game Makers is for you.**

Tas Game Makers (TasGM) is a community for anyone in Tasmania who makes, plays, or loves games. We're students, hobbyists, indie developers, remote workers at interstate and international studios, artists, musicians, writers, and everything in between. If games are part of your life, you're welcome here.

We're a broad group from all sorts of backgrounds, and we're always working to make our community more welcoming and inclusive. Game development isn't just programming—it's art, audio, design, writing, production, and more. There's a place for everyone.

TasGM started as the Tasmanian Game Development Society back in 2010. Since then we've grown to over 500 members, run Tasjam (Tasmania's statewide game jam series), and hosted countless meetups, workshops, and social events across the state.

We work closely with Screen Tasmania to support local game development. In 2026, we're proud to be helping operate **Level Up Tasmania**—a major public expo and industry conference celebrating Tasmanian game development talent.
