## Join Tas Game Makers

A TasGM membership costs $20 per year and gives access to member-only events, initiatives, and a vote at our AGM.

If you are unable to afford membership, please email hello@tasgamemakers.com or a member of the board and they can hook you up!

Membership fees go towards a range of things: stipends to compensate the time of some of our volunteers who are providing a service (setting up streaming / recording), budgets for event catering, venue hire, making an event bigger (game jams, let's plays) etc.

## Benefits

Along with running events and providing platforms for community interaction, TasGM offers individual memberships which give access to a range of benefits.

### Member only events + initiatives

TasGM hosts member-only events that offer the chance to meet other makers and practitioners in the industry. Help boost your career and skillset by learning from those active in the industry.

### Have your say

Members are required to attend TasGM's Annual General Meeting (AGM). Stay up to date with industry news and opportunities and get involved. Members vote in the board members of TasGM, helping to steer it in the direction the community wants most.

### Pay it forward

Want to help someone else join? You can purchase an extra membership to be passed on to a maker who might not be able to afford one. Just use the signup form below to buy an additional membership, or email us at hello@tasgamemakers.com if you'd like to arrange something specific.

## Become a Member

Your membership is valid for 12 months, and gives access to the benefits listed above. You can also purchase a 12-month membership for a future member, as part of our pay-it-forward initiative!
