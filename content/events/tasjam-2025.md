TasJam 2025 was a 2 week game jam with the theme **Glass Half Full**.

This jam was a little different to the usual TasJams — a 2 week long game jam, giving participants more time to work on something than just one weekend!

The jam kicked off at our November social meetup on **Wednesday 26th November** at 5:30pm at Hobart Brewing Co, and wrapped up on **Tuesday 9th December** at 6pm, with presentations on **Wednesday 10th December** in the evening.

Check out the submissions on the [jam page](https://itch.io/jam/tasjam2025).
