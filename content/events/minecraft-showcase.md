<h3 id="what-is-level-up-tasmania">What is Level Up Tasmania? How will selected entries be showcased at Level Up Tasmania?</h3>

Level Up Tasmania is an all-Tasmanian gaming event held in nipaluna/Hobart. It ran for the first time in 2024 and had over 2,000 visitors. It is running again on April 17th-19th 2026, and we expect it to be even bigger. A booth for the Minecraft Showcase will show selected entries from this competition alongside other booths for Tasmanian-made video games on the exhibition floor. In this way, students' work is presented alongside that of professional game developers. Participants are invited to visit the free event to view their work at the booth and meet the judges.

<h3 id="rules">Are there any rules about what I can build?</h3>

Submissions should relate to gaming, either by building something related to an existing video game or creating a new kind of video game experience. Some examples of what this could be:

* recreating a location from a video game
* building pixel art of a character from a video game
* making a redstone music box that plays the theme tune from a video game
* making a common Minecraft-based minigame like a boat racing circuit, hide and seek, maze, parkour course, or Spleef arena
* inventing a new kind of Minecraft-based minigame from your own imagination

Submissions **may be** designed for multiplayer, such as making a racing course that makes no sense to play alone. Submissions **may not** rely on custom mods or textures. World file submissions should use a recent version of Minecraft (1.19 or later), though any edition is fine. Any included text, such as on in-game signs, must be in English and include no coarse language.

As entries may be selected for showcasing at the Level Up Tasmania event, content must be **appropriate for a [PG](https://www.classification.gov.au/classification-ratings/parental-guidance) audience (even if you are building something based on a game that itself is rated higher)**. That means _what you build_ must not contain swearing, intense violence, adult themes, or be intended to be rude or offensive. If you're unsure whether what you have built fits these guidelines, you can ask a teacher, parent or guardian to contact the organisers via email at [paris@secretlab.games](mailto:paris@secretlab.games)

<h3 id="multiple-entries">Can a single student be part of multiple teams or entries?</h3>

Yes! A student can be part of more than one team and can submit multiple entries. Each entry should be submitted separately.

<h3 id="help-from-adults">Can students have help from parents, guardians, or teachers?</h3>

Yes! Students are welcome to get help from parents, guardians, or teachers. However, the work should be primarily the students' own — adults should be helping and guiding, not doing the building for them.

<h3 id="screenshots-and-world-files">How do I find screenshots I have taken in Minecraft? How do I export a world file from Minecraft?</h3>

If you have taken a screenshot in Minecraft, either using the F2 shortcut or the camera in Education edition, the screenshot will be saved on your computer. You'll have to first locate the folder where Minecraft lives on your computer (`%appdata%\.minecraft` on PC or `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft` on Mac) and copy the image you want. If you used the Xbox Game Bar to take a screenshot, it will be in your Xbox App under screenshots or in `%userprofile%\Videos\Captures` on your PC.

To make a world file you can upload, you'll need to **either** find your saved worlds on your computer or go into Minecraft and use the Export option. How to do this will differ depending on what edition of Minecraft you are playing on.

For Java edition:

1. Locate the folder where your Minecraft worlds are saved (`%appdata%\.minecraft\saves` on PC or `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves` on Mac)
2. Copy and compress the folder with the same name as the world you want to share

For Bedrock or Education editions on Desktop:

1. From the Minecraft main menu, click "Play" then "View My Worlds"
2. On the world you want to export, click "Manage" then "Export World" and select a location to save the file

If you require help with any of these steps, read the official Minecraft documentation or ask an adult. The easiest way to find your Minecraft folder on your computer is to open Minecraft, go into settings for Resource Packs and click "Open resource pack folder". This folder will be _inside_ the Minecraft folder.

<h3 id="submission-info">What information should I include with my submission?</h3>

If you built something to look at, and submitted screenshots, you should include information about what you built and why. This means what video game it's based on and why you chose it. This can be just 1 or 2 sentences, as long as it's enough for judges to understand what they are looking at.

If you built something to play, and submitted a world file, you should include a bit of extra information about how to play it. This might be a short description of an existing type of game inside Minecraft, or if you have invented something new we'll need the full instructions of how it works and what we should do.

<h3 id="judges">Who is judging the competition?</h3>

There are three judges who will be looking at all the entries, giving feedback to each:

* Kesh (AKA NestInTheNorthWest) - A Tasmanian Minecraft Streamer and Twitch Affiliate
* Mars (AKA AttackOnMars) - A Tasmanian Science Communicator and Award-Winning Minecrafter
* Paris Buttfield-Addison - A Tasmanian Game Developer and the President of Tas Gamemakers

<h3 id="prizes">What are the prizes I can win? How is it decided?</h3>

The top 3 stand-out entries will each receive $100 credit for [Area 52](https://area52.com.au/pages/3653-AboutUs), the largest pop culture store in Hobart that sells all sorts of games and gaming-related books, merch, and more. (Area 52 is not affiliated with this competition.)

Those 3 entries will be selected by the judges based on aspects like creativity and style. We're looking for creativity in how the medium of Minecraft is used to interpret the theme, interesting takes on the theme of gaming, and coordinated efforts like consistent style across the build. But the timeline for the competition is short, and the scale of each submission is a lesser factor. So there's no need to crunch or make something massive!

<h3 id="more-questions">What if I have more questions not answered here?</h3>

You can ask a teacher, parent or guardian to contact the president of Tas Gamemakers—the community organisation running this competition—via email at [paris@secretlab.games](mailto:paris@secretlab.games)
